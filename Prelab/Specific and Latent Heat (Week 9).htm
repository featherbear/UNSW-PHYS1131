You will do this by calculating the &#10;electrical power, P dissipated by a resistor. If one multimeter says that the current through the resistor is 1.4 A and the &#10;other multimeter tells you that the voltage drop across the resistor is 1.5 Volts. The temperature at this time is 24.00 C. &#10;What is the power dissipated by the resistor in Watts, W? &#10;2.1 &#10;w &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Untitled picture.png Machine generated alternative text:&#10;Question 2 &#10;Correct &#10;Marked out of 1.00 &#10;Flag question &#10;Copper has a specific heat of 390 Jkg-lK-l.
